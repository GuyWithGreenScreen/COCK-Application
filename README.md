C.O.C.K. Stands for Canadian Organization of Coding Knowledge, we specialize in making open source, free to use apps, games, addons, and other applications. You can find all of our apps and our community here: https://discord.gg/D4rxG3rYdr


Our dream for the C.O.C.K. Software:
The C.O.C.K. Program is a hub for tools and addons which you can find on our discord server made by us(when we do start making plugins as we are in the development stage still), or the community (READ THE CODE OF THE PLUGIN BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD IT!!! MAKE SURE YOU TRUST THE PLUGIN PUBLISHER!!!). Think of the C.O.C.K. Program as the motherboard, and the plugins as the components, the C.O.C.K. Program will provide you access to all the features your computer offers and the plugins can utilize them for their purposes. Or you can just the C.O.C.K. Software as an app launcher for open source apps and plugins, you control everything, it's all open source.
